\chapter{Model Predictive Control}

Model Predictive Control is a \textbf{\textit{feed back control}} algorithm that uses a model to make predictions about future outcomes of the process. Based on these predicted outcomes a control action can be implemented that optimizes the desired output. MPC can handle MIMO systems that is generally not possible using simple control algorithms such as PID.
